# tron-scripts.md — Canon

This is TRON's situation→script index. The seeder copies this to `meta/agents/tron/scripts.md`. Operator extends it freely per project. TRON consults this every time it composes a message to a worker or to the operator.

Each entry is one situation: when it fires, what TRON sends, what TRON does next.

---

## Spawn an engineer for a block

**Fires:** new block dispatched (`workflow-state.md` `current_block` changes).

**TRON sends (via stdin to `claude --bg`):**

```
You are ENG-{BLOCK_ID}. Block: {BLOCK_ID}. Branch: {BRANCH}.

Standing instructions (do not deviate):
- Follow your skill steps in order. Do not skip ahead.
- Be concise. No verbose explanations to TRON or to the operator.
- Validate locally before reporting DONE. Run lints, tests, type checks.
- Execute your session-end skill when work is complete.
- Do not self-terminate. After DONE, idle and wait for RELEASE from TRON.

Block spec: {BLOCK_PATH}
Worktree: {WORKTREE_PATH}
Architect on call (BG): ARCH-{BLOCK_ID} (session id: {ARCH_SESSION_ID})
TRON callback id: {TRON_SESSION_ID}

To reach TRON: `claude --resume {TRON_SESSION_ID} -p "[ENG-{BLOCK_ID}] <message>"`
To reach architect: `claude --resume {ARCH_SESSION_ID} -p "[ENG-{BLOCK_ID} → ARCH] <question>"`

Begin.
```

**Then:** append to `dispatched.log`; update `workflow-state.md` (`active_workers`); push `[TRON] PEER_UP: ENG-{BLOCK_ID} session={ENG_SESSION_ID}` to architect via `claude --resume {ARCH_SESSION_ID}` so architect can reply directly (see "Engineer ↔ architect peer-consult (R2)" below).

---

## Spawn the persistent architect (session start)

**Fires:** TRON cold-start, no architect in `active_workers`.

**TRON sends:**

```
You are ARCH-PERSIST. Session-long architect.

Standing instructions:
- Stay in BG. Idle when not consulted. Do not self-terminate.
- Concise answers. No filler.
- When TRON or an engineer pings you, answer the question precisely and idle.
- On session end, TRON will RELEASE you explicitly.

TRON callback id: {TRON_SESSION_ID}
Project profile: {PROJECT_MD_PATH}
Workflow rules: {WORKFLOW_MD_PATH}

Begin idle.
```

**Then:** update `workflow-state.md` (`active_workers`); architect stays alive until session end.

---

## Spawn a reviewer

**Fires:** `workflow-state.md` `blocks_since_review >= reviewer_threshold` (from `workflow.md` fixed config).

**TRON sends:**

```
You are REV-{DATE}-{N}. Reviewer pass over the last {N} merged blocks.

Standing instructions:
- Concise findings only. No prose padding.
- Each finding: file:line, what's wrong, severity (blocker/major/minor).
- Validate by reading code, not by re-running CI (already green).
- Do not self-terminate. Report findings, idle, wait for RELEASE.

Blocks in scope: {BLOCK_LIST}
PRs in scope: {PR_LIST}
Architect on call: ARCH-PERSIST ({ARCH_SESSION_ID})
TRON callback id: {TRON_SESSION_ID}

Begin.
```

**Then:** reset `blocks_since_review` to 0 on findings receipt.

---

## Engineer reports DONE

**Fires:** TRON receives `[ENG-{ID}] DONE` callback.

**TRON does:**
1. Read engineer's PR URL from message; verify PR open and CI green via `gh pr view`.
2. Send SV-01 query (template below).
3. If no SV-01 response in 2 sweeps: TRON self-validates AC against block spec (Premise 23).
4. Forward execute-phase log to architect for R5 review.
5. If architect flags: route remediation to a fresh engineer.
6. If all clear: send RELEASE to engineer.

**SV-01 query template:**

```
[TRON] @ENG-{ID}: SV-01. For each AC item in {block_spec_path}, report:
(a) delivered?
(b) tested locally (lints, types, tests)?
(c) verified against the live deployment (server/preview URL)?

List separately any items requiring operator manual verification (UI flows, TG bridges, third-party UAT, mobile builds, anything in project.md "Local-validation gaps").
```

**TRON sends RELEASE:**

```
[TRON] @ENG-{ID}: RELEASED. Read `skill-session-end-engineer.md`. Execute every applicable step in order. Then idle. TRON will close the process.
```

**Then:** `workflow-state.md`: increment `blocks_since_review`; clear engineer from `active_workers`; push `[TRON] PEER_DOWN: ENG-{BLOCK_ID}` to architect; `claude stop {SESSION_ID}` on the worker.

---

## Engineer ↔ architect peer-consult (R2)

**Fires:** never directly — this exchange does **not** route through TRON. Engineers send `[ENG-{ID} → ARCH] <q>` straight to `{ARCH_SESSION_ID}`; architect replies straight to `{ENG_SESSION_ID}` with `[ARCH-PERSIST → ENG-{ID}] <a>`.

**TRON's role:**
1. **At engineer spawn:** push the new `{ENG_SESSION_ID}` to architect via `claude --resume {ARCH_SESSION_ID} -p "[TRON] PEER_UP: ENG-{ID} session={ENG_SESSION_ID}"`. Architect stores it in session memory so it can reply directly.
2. **At engineer RELEASE:** notify architect via `claude --resume {ARCH_SESSION_ID} -p "[TRON] PEER_DOWN: ENG-{ID}"`. Architect drops the ID.
3. **On sweep:** TRON reads each worker's transcript via `~/.claude/jobs/{id}/` to observe consults — for logging, drift detection, and stall sweep. No intervention unless a wall is reported.

**Note:** if an engineer mistakenly sends `[ENG-{ID} → ARCH]` to TRON's session (wrong target), TRON re-instructs the engineer with the correct architect command. TRON does not forward.

---

## Wall hit → operator (R3)

**Fires:** worker reports UI/user-journey/T1/T5 wall, or TRON judges issue out-of-scope for backend.

**TRON does:**
1. Compose escalation: what worker, what block, what's blocking, what TRON has tried.
2. Invoke `skill-escalate` → sends via `scripts/tg-send.sh`.
3. Set `workflow-state.md` `paused_for_operator = {worker_id}`.
4. Idle that worker (no RELEASE yet).

---

## Stall sweep (every cron tick)

**Fires:** external cron triggers `sweep.sh` → posts wake message to TRON.

**TRON does for each `active_worker`:**

1. **Skip exclusions.** Do not stall-check workers whose status is `done-pending-release` (post-DONE idle, awaiting RELEASE) or whose ID matches `paused_for_operator` in `workflow-state.md` (paused by WALL escalation). These are silent by design.
2. **Probe liveness.** Confirm `~/.claude/jobs/{worker_id}/state.json` exists and the process is reachable. If missing, or `claude --resume {worker_id} -p "[TRON] PROBE"` exits non-zero → worker is dead. Purge from `active_workers`, log to `logs/recover-{date}.log`, no operator escalation (the block work is still open and will surface on next operator interaction).
3. **Activity check (Premise 22, extended).** Worker is **working** (skip stall this tick) if any of:
   - `state.json` `lastActivityAt` grew since last sweep tick.
   - Worktree has uncommitted changes (`git -C <worktree> status --porcelain` non-empty).
   - Worktree file mtimes grew since last sweep tick.
4. **Silence-ping threshold.** If silent ≥ `silence_ping_min` (from `workflow.md` fixed config, e.g. 6 min, must be a multiple of cron cadence) and no activity per step 3: send `claude --resume {worker_id} -p "[TRON] HEARTBEAT?"`. Mark `pinged_at = now` for this worker.
5. **Escalate threshold.** If silent ≥ `silence_escalate_min` (e.g. 8 min) and the ping at step 4 went unanswered (no activity, no callback since `pinged_at`): invoke `skill-escalate` with `reason=WORKER_UNRESPONSIVE`. Worker idles; do **not** RELEASE; do **not** auto-validate AC. `skill-validate` Mode B may run as read-only diagnosis to attach to the escalation message — it does not feed back into RELEASE.

Thresholds live in `workflow.md` fixed config; TRON reads them on session start. Cron cadence lives in `cron-install.sh` (`*/2` default); thresholds must be multiples thereof.

---

## TG inbound (every cron tick)

**Fires:** `tg-poll.sh` writes new messages to `tg-inbox.jsonl`; sweep tick checks file mtime.

**TRON does:**
1. Read new lines from `tg-inbox.jsonl` since last `tg_offset` in `state.md`.
2. Parse intent: bug report? Question? Status query? Workflow change request?
3. Bug → route to relevant engineer (or spawn one).
4. Status query → reply with `workflow-state.md` digest via tg-send.sh.
5. Workflow change → invoke `skill-edit-self` to apply changes atomically.
6. Update `tg_offset`.

---

## TRON session-end

**Fires:** operator says session done, OR `workflow-state.md` shows all blocks complete and no pending work.

**TRON runs `skill-session-end-tron`:**
1. Send RELEASE to every worker in `active_workers`.
2. Wait for each to finish their own session-end (or 60s timeout).
3. `claude stop` on each worker session.
4. Write session log to `logs/log-{date}-{slug}.md`.
5. Clear `dispatched.log` for next session.
6. Clear `current-id` (TRON's own ID file).
7. Write final state.

---

## TRON crash recovery

**Fires:** operator restarts TRON after crash mid-session.

**TRON runs `skill-recover`:**
1. Read `dispatched.log` — list of workers spawned this session.
2. For each, check `~/.claude/jobs/{id}/state.json` — alive? Done? Stalled?
3. Rebuild `active_workers` from live processes only.
4. Write new TRON session ID to `current-id`.
5. Broadcast new callback ID to each live worker via `claude --resume`.
6. Resume normal sweep cycle.

---

**Operator extending this doc:** add new situations as level-2 headings. Each entry must have: **Fires**, **TRON sends/does**, **Then**. TRON re-reads on session start.
