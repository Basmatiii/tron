## What this is

You point TRON at your project's pipeline. TRON dispatches and supervises a fleet of worker agents —
an architect, engineers, reviewers — and drives the work to done. **You talk to TRON. TRON talks to
everyone else.**

The core is a **deterministic engine**, not a chatbot improvising. A fixed dispatch loop decides what
happens next by lookup, never by guesswork; the language model is called only for the actual building
and for two narrow, typed judgments. That makes the flow predictable, inspectable, and lint-checked
before it ever runs.

## What this isn't

- A production runtime for unattended app traffic.
- A multi-machine fleet manager.

---

## How it works

- **Pipeline.** Your work is your project's own git-tracked pipeline — a living doc plus one file per
  block, each with an emoji status (`📋 to-do · 🔄 in-progress · ✅ done`, and a few non-active states).
  TRON only **reads** it; your agents write it via PR. TRON owns no pipeline, no agents, no work-unit format.
- **The architect clears the way.** A single persistent architect — *forward-looking only* — scopes the
  work ahead by **authoring the next block's file**. A block is dispatchable once its file is `📋` with
  every dependency already `✅` on trunk. It never reopens finished work; remediation is always a new block ahead.
- **Engineers build; reviewers check.** Engineers and reviewers share a worker pool (you set its size).
  An engineer takes one block, validates against its acceptance criteria, and reports done.
- **Done means done.** "Reports done" is just a trigger. TRON runs the canon definition-of-done on the
  *evidence* — local checks, then PR + green CI, merge, post-merge re-validation on trunk, deploy-clean
  + verify — and a block counts as done only when it shows `✅` on trunk. A merged branch that fails to
  deploy is not-done, and gets fixed.
- **Review is a milestone, not a verdict.** On a cadence you set (every N blocks that land `✅`), a
  reviewer delivers a findings log; the architect turns real findings into upcoming blocks.
- **Walls go to you.** Anything no worker can clear — an operator-only task, an external blocker, a
  call only you can make — parks the block and asks you. Everything short of that stays in the fleet.
- **It runs on its own.** A cron heartbeat wakes the engine on a fixed cadence; each wake is one
  bounded tick — fill free slots, clear ahead, wait, or end — and surfaces to you only what matters.

The engine spine (the dispatch loop + the work-selector) is code and never an LLM call. The LLM is
asked exactly two questions: *classify this inbound message* and, rarely, *is this really the
operator's problem?* Each is schema-in, schema-out — never free prose steering the flow.

## What TRON needs from your project

TRON reads your project's structure — it never scaffolds it. Before you seed, the project must
provide three things, all git-tracked and written by your agents via PR:

- **Agents.** Your own worker personas — an architect, engineers, reviewers, whatever roles the work
  calls for — as `agents/<role>.md`. TRON dispatches them; it ships none and imposes none.
- **Blocks.** Your work, specified and broken into right-sized units. One file per block
  (`blocks/<id>.md`) carrying a fixed header — status, dependencies, reviewer class, and the merge and
  deploy gates — plus its acceptance criteria. A block is the unit TRON dispatches, gates, and drives
  to done.
- **A pipeline.** A living document (`pipeline.md`) that orders the blocks into phases and tracks each
  one's status. Its shape is fixed enough for TRON to read deterministically, loose enough to stay
  human-authored.

TRON only reads these; your agents own and write them. The 42labs `new-project-template` ships this
structure ready-made — adopt it for a new project, or bring an existing one up to it before seeding.

---

## Requirements

- `python3` and `git`.
- `jq` (the shell connectors parse JSON).
- `crontab` (the autonomous heartbeat).
- A background-capable agent runtime on `PATH` — the runtime that runs the worker agents TRON
  dispatches. TRON drives it; you never address it directly.

## Commands

Two commands. Everything else is internal (the heartbeat, recovery, and validation run themselves).

| Command | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| `tron seeder` | Seed TRON into a target project — an interview that detects your repo, settles the knobs, and writes the instance. Touches only TRON's own folder. Run from the project root. |
| `tron start`  | Wake TRON — a short bootup (where to start, how many workers) then the live console: watch the fleet, talk to TRON, `stop` when you're done. |

```bash
# 1. From a canon clone, seed TRON into your project:
cd ~/code/my-project
~/code/tron/tron seeder

# 2. Wake it (from the seeded instance):
<agents>/tron/tron start
```

Inside `tron start`: type to talk to TRON; `status` / `pipeline` to look; `stop` to end.

## File layout — canon (this repo)

```
tron/

```

TRON ships no agents and no pipeline of its own: it reads the project's `agents/*.md` and its
git-tracked canon pipeline (`pipeline.md` + `blocks/`), which the `new-project-template` defines.

## File layout — your project (after `tron seeder`)

```
<agents>/tron.md            # the judgment context (copied)
<agents>/tron/
├── tron · engine/          # the entrypoint + the deterministic engine (canon, copied)
├── project.yaml            # this project's pointers, agents, repo facts
├── workflow.yaml           # this project's knobs
├── routing.yaml · messages.yaml · protocols/ · scripts/   # canon, copied verbatim
└── …runtime state…         # workflow-state, logs, inboxes (gitignored, edited in place)
```

To remove TRON entirely: delete `<agents>/tron.md` and `<agents>/tron/`. No other traces.

## Design principles

> **Blueprint first, model second.** TRON's founding principle. The flow is a deterministic
> *blueprint* — a closed trigger grammar and an explicit event table, lint-validated before it ever
> runs. The *model* comes second: called only to do the building and to answer two bounded,
> schema-checked judgments — never to choose a step. Everything below follows from this.

- **Deterministic spine.** Flow is decided by code and a closed trigger grammar — lint-validated at
  seed time, so a malformed workflow fails before it runs, not during.
- **Two bounded judgments.** The only LLM calls into the flow are typed and schema-checked; the model
  never returns prose that steers a transition.
- **Architect out of the pool, forward-only.** Clearing throughput is the one knob that bounds speed;
  finished work is never reopened.
- **Every word is canon copy.** All operator- and worker-facing text comes from one registry — no
  backend narration ever reaches a human.
- **Crash-safe ticks.** State is persisted atomically; dispatch intent is committed before any spawn,
  and messages are processed at-least-once — a crashed wake retries cleanly.
- **Canon purity.** This repo carries zero project- or machine-specific traces; per-project values
  live only in the seeded instance.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. TRON is a canon repo — one source of truth — so contributions extend the canon
itself: a new worker skill or reviewer lens, a sharper protocol, an engine or lint improvement, better
docs. Per-project or machine-specific assumptions live in seeded instances, never here. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the clone → branch → PR → CI → merge flow.
