## What this is

You hand TRON a pipeline of spec'd work. TRON dispatches and supervises a fleet of worker agents —
an architect, engineers, reviewers — and drives the work to done. **You talk to TRON. TRON talks to
everyone else.**

The core is a **deterministic engine**, not a chatbot improvising. A fixed dispatch loop decides what
happens next by lookup, never by guesswork; the language model is called only for the actual building
and for two narrow, typed judgments. That makes the flow predictable, inspectable, and lint-checked
before it ever runs.

## What this isn't

- A production runtime for unattended app traffic.
- A multi-machine fleet manager.

---

## How it works

- **Pipeline.** Your work is a list of blocks, each tied to a spec, each with a status:
  `pending · cleared · in-progress · blocked · done · abandoned`.
- **The architect clears the way.** A single persistent architect — *forward-looking only* — reviews
  the work ahead and marks the next block `cleared`. Only a `cleared` block is dispatchable. It never
  reopens finished work; remediation is always a new block ahead.
- **Engineers build; reviewers check.** Engineers and reviewers share a worker pool (you set its size).
  An engineer takes one cleared block, validates against its acceptance criteria, and reports done.
- **Review is a milestone, not a verdict.** On a cadence you set (every N completed blocks), a reviewer
  delivers a findings log; the architect turns real findings into upcoming blocks.
- **Walls go to you.** Anything no worker can clear — an operator-only task, an external blocker, a
  call only you can make — parks the block and asks you. Everything short of that stays in the fleet.
- **It runs on its own.** A cron heartbeat wakes the engine on a fixed cadence; each wake is one
  bounded tick — fill free slots, clear ahead, wait, or end — and surfaces to you only what matters.

The engine spine (the dispatch loop + the work-selector) is code and never an LLM call. The LLM is
asked exactly two questions: *classify this inbound message* and, rarely, *is this really the
operator's problem?* Each is schema-in, schema-out — never free prose steering the flow.

## The flow

![TRON supervisor workflow — BPMN](diagrams/flow-bpm.svg)

<sub>The Dispatcher (**PULSE**) fans work to the engineer, architect, and reviewer tracks. A **⚙** marks where a deterministic script runs — *that* one runs is the point; which, and how many, is project-dynamic. Workers build, review, and scope; a **wall** parks the block and asks the **operator**; every track returns to **PULSE** (`↻`). · [Interactive version](diagrams/flow-bpm.html) (light/dark toggle).</sub>

## Requirements

- `python3` and `git`.
- `jq` (the shell connectors parse JSON).
- `crontab` (the autonomous heartbeat).
- A background-capable agent runtime on `PATH` — the runtime that runs the worker agents TRON
  dispatches. TRON drives it; you never address it directly.

## Commands

Two commands. Everything else is internal (the heartbeat, recovery, and validation run themselves).

| Command | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| `tron seeder` | Seed TRON into a target project — an interview that detects your repo, settles the knobs, and writes the instance. Touches only TRON's own folder. Run from the project root. |
| `tron start`  | Wake TRON — a short bootup (where to start, how many workers) then the live console: watch the fleet, talk to TRON, `stop` when you're done. |

```bash
# 1. From a canon clone, seed TRON into your project:
cd ~/code/my-project
~/code/tron/tron seeder

# 2. Wake it (from the seeded instance):
<agents>/tron/tron start
```

Inside `tron start`: type to talk to TRON; `status` / `pipeline` to look; `stop` to end.

## Design principles

> **Blueprint first, model second.** TRON's founding principle. The flow is a deterministic
> *blueprint* — a closed trigger grammar and an explicit event table, lint-validated before it ever
> runs. The *model* comes second: called only to do the building and to answer two bounded,
> schema-checked judgments — never to choose a step. Everything below follows from this.

- **Deterministic spine.** Flow is decided by code and a closed trigger grammar — lint-validated at
  seed time, so a malformed workflow fails before it runs, not during.
- **Two bounded judgments.** The only LLM calls into the flow are typed and schema-checked; the model
  never returns prose that steers a transition.
- **Architect out of the pool, forward-only.** Clearing throughput is the one knob that bounds speed;
  finished work is never reopened.
- **Every word is canon copy.** All operator- and worker-facing text comes from one registry — no
  backend narration ever reaches a human.
- **Crash-safe ticks.** State is persisted atomically; dispatch intent is committed before any spawn,
  and messages are processed at-least-once — a crashed wake retries cleanly.
- **Canon purity.** This repo carries zero project- or machine-specific traces; per-project values
  live only in the seeded instance.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. TRON is a canon repo — one source of truth — so contributions extend the canon
itself: a new worker skill or reviewer lens, a sharper protocol, an engine or lint improvement, better
docs. Per-project or machine-specific assumptions live in seeded instances, never here. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the clone → branch → PR → CI → merge flow.
